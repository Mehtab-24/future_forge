# Future Forge

**Future Forge** is an AI-powered career simulation platform designed to help individuals explore, design, and optimize their career journeys through interactive, data-driven foresight rather than static recommendations.

Instead of answering the question *“What job should I do?”*, Future Forge helps users ask —  
**“What could my future look like if I make this decision today?”**

Built collaboratively as a full-stack project, Future Forge combines modern web technologies with generative AI to turn career planning into an immersive, exploratory experience.

## 🌟 Project Vision

Career planning today is often overwhelming, static, and anxiety-inducing. Most platforms provide fixed suggestions based on limited inputs, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world careers.

Future Forge reimagines this experience as a **living simulation engine**.  
Users can experiment with different decisions, constraints, and ambitions — and instantly visualize how those changes ripple across time.

The goal is simple but powerful:
> **Transform career anxiety into career clarity.**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Profiling**  
   Users input their skills, interests, education level, location preferences, and constraints such as budget, time, or work-life balance.

2. **AI Reasoning Layer**  
   The backend validates and processes this data, then invokes the **Google Gemini API** to reason over the inputs and generate realistic, context-aware career pathways.

3. **Career Simulation**  
   Each simulation includes:
   - Possible job roles and transitions
   - Time-based milestones
   - Skill requirements
   - Salary progression trends

4. **Interactive Visualization**  
   Results are presented through a clean, interactive timeline interface built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, allowing users to explore milestones and narratives intuitively.

5. **Iterative Exploration (Butterfly Effect Engine)**  
   Users can tweak inputs — learning a new skill, switching cities, or pursuing certifications — and immediately see alternative futures unfold.

## 🦋 The Butterfly Effect Engine

At the heart of Future Forge is the **Butterfly Effect Engine**.

Small changes in user decisions can lead to dramatically different long-term outcomes.  
Future Forge allows users to simulate these changes in real time, making abstract career consequences tangible and understandable.

Examples:
- Learning a new technology and seeing how it accelerates growth
- Relocating to a different city and observing opportunity shifts
- Evaluating whether higher education or certifications are worth the investment

Each simulation is paired with an **actionable roadmap**, outlining:
- What to learn
- When to upskill
- How to position oneself for future opportunities
